# MLP-UAV-State-Prediction

This repository consists of 3 basic python examples for Machine Learning for newbies. We have performed classification task on the given data for predicting the state of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We have used MLP for the same. The three different codes perform different classifications on the using all or only a part of the data. <br />
I hope Machine Learning enthusiasts will find it useful. <br />
Cheers!

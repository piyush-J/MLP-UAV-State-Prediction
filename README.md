# MLP-UAV-State-Prediction

This repository consists of 3 basic Python codes for newbies in Machine Learning. We have performed classification task on my data collected for predicting the state of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using MLP (a technique used in machine learning). The three different codes perform different classification tasks using all or only a part of the data. <br />
I hope Machine Learning enthusiasts will find it useful. <br />
Cheers!
